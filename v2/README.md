EXPORTING NEW WORKBOOKS

## STEPS TO RUN PROGRAM: ##

	1. Unzip Stocker.zip

		If you're reading this, you've already unzipped it. By default,
		the folder unzipped into the directory that it was downloaded to,
		most likely your 'Downloads' folder. Move it to your 'Desktop' folder.

	2. Open PowerShell

		You can search for this by hitting your Windows key and typing 
		'PowerShell'

	3. Copy/paste the following line into the PowerShell terminal

		cd './Desktop/Stocker/'

	4. Install Python 3.9

		type 'python3' into the PowerShell terminal and hit enter.
		this will bring you to the Microsoft store where you can
		download it easily. you need this so your computer can interpret
		the app (it is written in python!)

	5. Make the app

		Type 'make' or 'make app' into the PowerShell terminal and hit enter.
		This will execute the Makefile in the directory.

	6. You're done!

		The app should start once make is complete.
